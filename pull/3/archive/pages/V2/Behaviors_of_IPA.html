</ul>
<section id="types-of-screens">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Types of Screens<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-screens" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>So far, these are the following classes of screens:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Selection Screens: These are the screens that let a user choose an
individual object from an entire list. These pages are: 110, 118,
130, 138, 150 and 160.</p></li>
<li><p>Element page - Details: This is the first page of editing each of the
group types, and is generally a freely formatted form. These pages
are 111, 119, 131, 139, 151 and 161.</p></li>
<li><p>Element Page - Set Container: These pages allow users to add to or
remove from a set of objects around a particular criteria that are
all contained by a particular object – for instance, users in a
group, host groups in a netgroup, or roles of a user. These pages
are: 112-2, 120, 121, 139-1, 140, 152, 153, 154, 155 and 157</p></li>
<li><p>Element Page - Set Contained-within: These pages allow users to add
or remove from the set of objects of a given type that contain a
particular object – for instance, the groups that a user is contained
in, or the host groups that are contained in other host groups. These
pages are 112, 112-1, 122, 123, 132, 132-1, 141, 142 and 158</p></li>
<li><p>Create Object Pop Up: This pop up allows the user to create a new
top-level object, and then to either edit it, add another object, or
cancel. The pop ups contain only the basic information needed to
create a record. These pages are 110a, 118b, 130a, 138a, 150a, and
160a.</p></li>
<li><p>Add to Set Pop Up - Container: This pop up allows users to add
multiple objects into the particular object that hosts the pop-up.
These pages are: 112c, 120a, 121a, 139a, 140a, 152a, 153a, 154a,
155a, and 157a.</p></li>
<li><p>Add to Set Pop Up – Contained Within:: This pop up allows users to
add a given object to many different groups that can contain the
object. These pages are: 112a, 112b, 122a, 123a, 132a, 132b, 141a,
142a, and 158a.</p></li>
<li><p>Alert pop-ups: This pop up shows a warning, forcing the user to
acknowledge something before continuing. This page is: 118a.</p></li>
<li><p>Certificate Pop-ups: These pop ups are part of the workflow for
adding a certificate to an object. They are: 131a, 131b, 131c, 161a,
161b, and 161c.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="common-actions">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Common Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#common-actions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Following are some overall actions that are common through all the site:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Page Scrolling: Scrolling will be at a page level. There will be no
separate scrolling regions within a page.</p></li>
<li><p>Length of Lists (i.e. number of entries in list): All lists of
objects will siaplay up to a maximum of number of entries. That
maximum will either be fixed, or be configurable via some mechanism.
When a page hits the IPA server for a list, if less than the maximum
are returned, all are displayed. If the maximum or more are returned,
a message will appear telling the user that only the first number of
records are being shown, and will encourage users to refine their
query.</p></li>
<li><p>Column Headers: Column headers in lists are clickable, and will sort
the returned entries in first ascending, then descending order for
that column. A down arrow is shown for descending order, an up arrow
for ascending order</p></li>
<li><p>Exiting a page with “dirty” information: Whenever content on a page
has changed and the user navigates to a new page, an Alert pop up
will come up that asks the user if he wants to save changes before
continuing. There will be 3 options, return to page, discard changes
and continue, save changes and continue.</p></li>
<li><p>Find String Wildcaring: Standard wildcards (? and *) should apply in
find strings</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="common-screen-areas">
<span id="id4"></span><h3>Common Screen Areas<a class="headerlink" href="#common-screen-areas" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Across the site, there are some areas of the screen that either appear
always, or quite often. Here’s a description of some of those areas, and
some of the behaviors they have:</p>
<section id="banner">
<h4>Banner<a class="headerlink" href="#banner" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Product logo, and an indicator who is logged in.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The user name is itself a link, and clicking on that link will take
the user to their own user identity entry page.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="main-nav">
<span id="id5"></span><h4>Main Nav<a class="headerlink" href="#main-nav" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Identities, Policis or IPA Configuration.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>NB: We need to describe behavior when user clicks on main nav…</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="secondary-nav">
<span id="id6"></span><h4>Secondary Nav<a class="headerlink" href="#secondary-nav" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>For Identities, the nav is Users, Groups, Hosts, Host Groups, Netgroups,
and Services.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clicking on a secondary nav item brings the user to the Selection
page for that type of object, subject to the “dirty data” policy
described later.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="page-title">
<span id="id7"></span><h4>Page Title<a class="headerlink" href="#page-title" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Main page status for user</p>
</section>
<section id="help">
<h4>Help<a class="headerlink" href="#help" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The bottom of every page has page-specific help reminders for functions
on that page.</p>
</section>
<section id="element-navigator">
<span id="id8"></span><h4>Element Navigator<a class="headerlink" href="#element-navigator" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>All sub-pages to each identity object have at top a ribbon that allow
the user to choose different elements of the object to view and edit.</p>
<p>Clicking on any element in the element navigator will bring the user to
that page. However, a check is first done to see if there is any “dirty”
data on screen. This is described later.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="selection-screens">
<span id="id9"></span><h2>Selection Screens<a class="headerlink" href="#selection-screens" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
</section>
<section id="element-pages-details">
<span id="id10"></span><h2>Element Pages: Details<a class="headerlink" href="#element-pages-details" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Common behaviors</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Each Details screen has a pair of buttons named Reset and Save
Changes</p></li>
<li><p>When the editable content on the screen is “clean”, both Reset and
Save Changes are grayed out.</p></li>
<li><p>When the editable content on the screen is “dirty”, both buttons are
active</p></li>
<li><p>Reset returns the editable fields to the way they were before they
were changed</p></li>
<li><p>Save Changes stores all changes in the fields, making the content now
“clean”, and therefore disabling the Reset and Save changes buttons</p></li>
<li><p>Details screens that are defined as “long” get Reset and Save buttons
on the top right and bottom left of the overall Details region</p></li>
<li><p>Details screens that are defind as “short” get only one set of
buttons on the top right.</p></li>
<li><p>Long screens are: 111, 131, and 161</p></li>
<li><p>Short screens are 119, 139, and 151</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="create-object-pop-ups">
<span id="id11"></span><h2>Create Object Pop Ups<a class="headerlink" href="#create-object-pop-ups" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>These pop ups all require only the basic information needed to create an
object.</p>
<p>Common behaviors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On entry, all fields are empty</p></li>
<li><p>At the bottom, there are 3 buttons, “Cancel”, “Create” object, and
“Create and Edit” object.</p></li>
<li><p>Cancel returns to the calling page</p></li>
<li><p>Create attempts to create the object, and then control stays on the
Pop Up</p></li>
<li><p>Create and Edit attempts to create the object, and then control goes
to the “Details” page of the newly created object.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Create” and “Create and Edit” buttons should be grayed out until
sufficient text has been entered or options have been chosen in the
pop up.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a fatal error in creating the object, control returns to
the calling page, with an error message placed in the calling
screen’s message area.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="create-host-and-create-service-130a-and-160a">
<span id="id12"></span><h3>Create Host and Create Service (130a and 160a)<a class="headerlink" href="#create-host-and-create-service-130a-and-160a" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When the user clicks on the “Resolve” button, the contents of the
text field are submitted to be resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>If the string resolves correctly, a message appears under the text
box saying that the Host Resolves.</p></li>
<li><p>If the string doesn’t resolve, a message appears under the text box
saying that the Host can not be resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>If the user clicks on either “Create” or “Create and Edit”, the
resolve is done automatically</p></li>
<li><p>If the host name can not be resolved, the pop-up is replaced by
another alert popup telling the user the host name can not be
resolved, and asking the user if he wants to continue anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Both Create buttons are grayed out until the user enters a host name</p></li>
<li><p>For Create Service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Create buttons are grayed out until a service is chosen</p></li>
<li><p>The text box under the pull-down list is disabled unless the user
selects, “Other” as the service name</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, the Create buttons are grayed out until at least one
character is entered in the Service box</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: These instructions may be modified when discussion about the DNS
section of IPA is fleshed out and we decide if/how to allow users to
automatically add new host to DNS</p>

<section id="add-to-set-pop-ups">
<span id="id13"></span><h2>Add to Set Pop Ups<a class="headerlink" href="#add-to-set-pop-ups" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>These pop ups all have two lists – a list of available objects (source
list), and a “bag” of objects to add (target list). Common behaviors are
listed below, behaviors particular to individual screens are listed
after.</p>
<p>Common behaviors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On entry, the source list and the target list are both empty</p></li>
<li><p>Users type into an empty “find” box and press the adjacent “find”
button</p></li>
<li><p>In this state, the user must be able to see the whole pop-up,
including the instructions</p></li>
<li><p>At any point, if the user clicks “Cancel”, the pop-up will dismiss
and control will return to the calling page, with no changes made.</p></li>
<li><p>When the user clicks “Find”, the string is matched against all
eligible objects, and:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All matched objects that are not already included in the set are
presented in the **Source list with a graphic pointing to the
Target list.</p></li>
<li><p>This graphic should have a tool-tip that says, “Add to prospective
list”</p></li>
<li><p>Matched objects that are already included in the set are presented
as disabled, and do not have a graphic pointing to the Target
list.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When the user clicks the “Add to prospective list” graphic, the item
disappears from the Source list and appears in the Target list with a
graphic pointing back to the Source list.</p></li>
<li><p>This graphic should have a tool-tip that says, “Remove from
prospective list”</p></li>
<li><p>Clicking the “Remove from prospective list” graphic causes the item
to disappear from the Target list and re-appear in the Source list</p></li>
<li><p>Messages are displayed in the message area after each find or add or
remove from prospective list.</p></li>
<li><p>No more than the maximum number of entries are displayed in the
Source list</p></li>
<li><p>The entire pop-up scrolls vertically</p></li>
<li><p>No action is taken until the user clicks the action button on the
bottom of the pop-up.</p></li>
<li><p>After the action button is pressed, all items in the Target list are
added to the Set</p></li>
<li><p>The success or failure to do the add should be displayed in the
Message area of the calling screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Should any of those individual adds fail because the item is already
in the set – which can happen only if another user beat this user in
a race condition to add the item – the message in the calling screen
should be advisory only, and not report an error.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="add-host-to-host-group-or-net-group-pop-ups-139a-and-154a">
<span id="id14"></span><h3>Add Host to Host Group or Net Group Pop-ups (139a and 154a)<a class="headerlink" href="#add-host-to-host-group-or-net-group-pop-ups-139a-and-154a" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In a special case, the system will allow the user to add a host as
“unmanaged”. The case is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are no wildcards in the find string</p></li>
<li><p>There are no exact matches with any existing host</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In this case, the first entry displayed in the Source list would be
the exact name of the hose in the search string, with the text
“(unmanaged)” next to it.</p></li>
<li><p>There would still be a graphic that would allow the name to be added
to the Target list, and one in the target list to move it back to the
Source list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NB: What do we do if there is an unmanaged host with name foo, and a
user later adds a managed host with the name foo. Do we allow it?</p>
