<span id="id1"></span><h1>Overview of D-BUS Protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-d-bus-protocol" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The D-BUS protocol was designed as an IPC mechanism for use in desktop
components. The D-BUS specification provides a marshalled wire format
for transmitting signals and method calls to other processes.</p>
<p>The D-BUS protocol has four primary components:</p>
<section id="the-d-bus-server">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>The D-BUS Server<a class="headerlink" href="#the-d-bus-server" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A common source of confusion, the D-BUS server is not a server in the
traditional sense. Rather than accepting connections and listening for
requests on that connection, the D-BUS server is instead used only for
establishing connections.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-d-bus-connection">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>The D-BUS Connection<a class="headerlink" href="#the-d-bus-connection" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the workhorse of the D-BUS protocol. Once a D-BUS connection has
been made to a D-BUS server, it becomes a peer-to-peer connection.
Either end of the connection can listen for method calls or signals, and
either end can initiate them.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-d-bus-message">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>The D-BUS Message<a class="headerlink" href="#the-d-bus-message" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>D-BUS messages come in three primary forms. These are D-BUS method
calls, D-BUS Signals and D-BUS errors. D-BUS signals and D-BUS errors
are one-way messages from one end of a D-BUS connection to the other,
intended to carry a brief message (such as a signal to start or stop a
service, or a notification that an error has occurred in the
connection). D-BUS errors are usually generated by the internal D-BUS
API itself, though they can be generated by your own code as well.</p>
<p>D-BUS method calls are the bread-and-butter of the D-BUS protocol. The
purpose of these calls is to essentially run a method on a remote
process and treat it as if it had been run locally. These calls may (or
may not) receive replies from the other end of the connection.</p>
<p>D-BUS method calls can be invoked in a blocking or nonblocking method,
but within the SSSD we will use the nonblocking approach exclusively
(except in unit test binaries, where events should be in serial)</p>
<p>Details of the message specification can be read at

<section id="the-d-bus-system-bus">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>The D-BUS System Bus<a class="headerlink" href="#the-d-bus-system-bus" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The system bus is a special implementation of the D-BUS protocol. It was
designed by the freedesktop project to handle communication between the
many system daemons. The system bus is an implementation of the D-BUS
server that will act as a central routing station for D-BUS
communication between services that are registered to it. When using the
system bus, a D-BUS client can initiate a connection and then
communicate indirectly to other processes also connected to the bus by
sending a message with a known destination.</p>
<p>In the SSSD, we do not use the system bus due to the heavy traffic that
it sees from the desktop components. Instead we will rely on using the
direct connections.</p>

<section id="sssd-and-d-bus">
<span id="id6"></span><h1>SSSD and D-BUS<a class="headerlink" href="#sssd-and-d-bus" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>In the SSSD, we have implemented a version of the D-BUS protocol that we
call the SBUS. The SBUS is built atop libdbus-1 from the freedesktop
project, but will implement only a subset of D-BUS features.</p>
<section id="sssd-infrastructure">
<span id="id7"></span><h2>SSSD Infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#sssd-infrastructure" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SSSD makes use of the event library developed by the Samba project.
This event library implements a very robust mainloop for processes.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of the nonblocking features of the D-BUS
server and D-BUS connection, these portions of the D-BUS API must be
integrated into the process’ mainloop. We have developed a set of
SSSD-specific helper functions to simplify this integration. There is a
library of SBUS tools located within the “sbus” directory in the SSSD
tree.</p>
</section>
<section id="sbus-server">
<span id="id8"></span><h2>SBUS Server<a class="headerlink" href="#sbus-server" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SBUS server will be run on one side or the other of any SSSD process
that requires communication from other processes. Some examples of this
are the Monitor service (which uses SBUS to verify the availability of
the SSSD processes) and the Data Provider (which will listen for cache
update requests from NSS, PAM and INFO pipe, as well as serving requests
to Data Provider Backends such as FreeIPA)</p>
<p>Instantiating an SBUS server using the SBUS library can be done with the
sbus_new_server() helper routine. This call requires a pointer to an
event context and a function to properly set up new connections. This
helper function will handle the primary duties of setting up a new
connection, and then will invoke the function specified by the user. Put
more simply, this function describes what to do with a new connection
once it’s established.</p>
<p>An example from the monitor code is to transmit an identity request to
the new connection. Once this request returns, the Monitor will be able
to keep track of which of the required services are alive, and which pid
they are using.</p>
