The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v3.2.2.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The new
version has also been built for Fedora 19 and is on its way to
updates-testing.

**Important**: please see section *Upgrading* before upgrading the
packages, a manual procedure is needed for FreeIPA servers with CA
originally installed with FreeIPA version prior to 3.1.

Upgrading
---------

.. _freeipa_servers_with_ca_installed_prior_to_version_3.1:

FreeIPA servers with CA installed prior to version 3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Manual upgrade procedure <Howto/Dogtag9ToDogtag10Migration>`__ is
required for FreeIPA servers installed with version prior to
`3.1 <IPAv3_310>`__.

.. _other_freeipa_servers_and_clients:

Other FreeIPA servers and clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the performance improvements requires an extended set
of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a
excessive number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.

mailing list (http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-users) or
