<p><em>Prerequisite:</em> Company has a 3rd party 2FA authentication server
provided by a vendor. All known commonly used authentication servers
support authentication via RADIUS protocol.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>IPA users should be able to authenticate using passwords (as it is
now) until as specific administrative action is taken against their
account.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrator should be able to define a subset of user accounts that
must authenticate using external RADIUS server. That means that after
this administrative action is taken user can’t authenticate using his
Kerberos password. He can only use his 2FA credential (usually PIN
and token code) as instructed by the OTP solution vendor. It is
implied that the environment would use kerberos libraries via sssd or
kinit coming from the Kerberos version not earlier than 1.12. There
is no intent to support OTP based 2FA for the direct LDAP binds to
the IPA directory. Selected users would not be able to bind directly
to LDAP using OTP credentials from the external vendor. However they
should be able to authenticate over the Kerberos protocol, acquire
TGT and then bind to LDAP using GSSAPI.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result of the kerberos authentication using 2FA credential IPA
KDC must issue a TGT that can then be used for access of the
resources in IPA domain as well as negotiation of the SSO access to
the resources in the trusted domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrator should be able to define this set of users using UI and
CLI</p></li>
<li><p>It would be preferable if administrator can select a group of users
and apply the setting. If the association is removed the user can
again use his Kerberos password to authenticate, however it might be
prudent to require user to change the password on his first
authentication after the association with the remote OTP solution was
removed.</p></li>
<li><p>There can be only one RADIUS server configuration per user.
Configuring more then one should be prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>IPA system should have no knowledge about the type of credential the
user used. The only pieces of information that it needs to know are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>whether the user account needs to proxy what user credential or
not</p></li>
<li><p>what name user should be mapped to</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The map that the user can be mapped to can be defined in different
ways. By default with no special configuration user ‘uid’ should be
used. Administrator should be able to define an alternative attribute
for example user Kerberos principal or some other attribute for
example employee ID or badge number created and populated by the
customer for alternative user identification.</p></li>
<li><p>IPA should be capable of storing configuration for different groups
of RADIUS servers so that a subset of users is authenticated against
one set of RADIUS servers represented by one vendor while other
subset of users can authenticate against another set of RADIUS
servers represented by another vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrative interface UI/CLI should allow to define radius server
configuration. This configuration should include: list of RADIUS
server hosts with optional ports, RADIUS secret,number of retries,
timeout of each retry. The secret, timeout and retries are expected
to be the same across all RADIUS servers of the same set.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>IPA users should be able to authenticate using passwords as it is now
until as specific administrative action is taken against their
account.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrator should be able to define a subset of user accounts that
must authenticate using OTP tokens stored inside IPA. That means that
after this administrative action is taken user can’t authenticate
using his Kerberos password. He can only use his 2FA credential which
consists of his Kerberos password as PIN and the OTP from one of the
tokens that was assigned to him. It is implied that the environment
would use Kerberos libraries via sssd or kinit coming from the
Kerberos version not earlier than 1.12.</p></li>
<li><p>If both RADIUS config and local tokens are assigned to user the
authentication should be proxied to the external RADIUS server.</p></li>
<li><p>Selected users would be able to bind directly to LDAP using OTP
credentials using locally defined tokens</p></li>
<li><p>There can be more than one token assigned to the user.</p></li>
<li><p>System should support software tokens and hardware tokens</p></li>
<li><p>It should be possible to create and provision software tokens as
needed via UI and/or CLI</p></li>
<li><p>It should be possible to import external XML file (RFC 6030) with the
external tokens provided by a 3rd party vendor (mostly HW tokens) and
manage them in the system.</p></li>
<li><p>The device information that comes from 3rd party vendor XML should be
loaded into the system and preserved in the system as is (probably
protected from modification by ACIs by default).</p></li>
<li><p>There should be a CLI/UI to manage tokens.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It should implement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Token Creation</p></li>
<li><p>Token Editing</p></li>
<li><p>Token Deletion (except the last active token)</p></li>
<li><p>Token Synchronization</p></li>
<li><p>Token Assignment (manager / owner)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Admins should be able to perform all the above operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Users should have permission to synchronize tokens owned by them.
Additionally, users should have access to create, edit, and delete
all tokens managed by them.</p></li>
<li><p>The user should be able to access the UI before tokens are
provisioned using the first factor.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There should be a self service portal, available outside the
firewall, implementing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Token Synchronization</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>System should support basic “Lost token” use case. This means that if
the user looses his token he should call a help desk and a temporary
authentication solution should be given to him. The solution should
have a validity time and expire after. User should be able to use
this solution until he can use a token again or it expires.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the user was capable of using any of his lost token the
capability of using temporary solution should be removed from him
automatically without administrator’s involvement.</p></li>
<li><p>Temporary solution should be at least as strong as user’s original
Kerberos password</p></li>
<li><p>It is not required so far to support more complex lost password
scenarios however system should assume that more complex lost
password scenarios will be required in future</p></li>
<li><p>Tokens can be disabled by administrator. Once disabled the token
can’t be used until it is enabled back by administrator.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrator should be able to define a start date and end date of
the validity of the token. This is the range that constraints the
token authentication. The device data (start and end dates for the
device) loaded from the XML file should not be considered
authoritative.</p></li>
<li><p>Until a true offline authentication is supported there should be a
way to authenticate offline with just password but not acquire
Kerberos ticket. If the system was offline but got online and there
is no Kerberos ticket, the system should prompt user for
re-authentication by locking his screen as soon as he gets online.</p></li>

<p>The krb5 client and KDC code is implemented according to the designs
here:
` &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Responder">http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Responder</a>&gt;`__<a class="reference external" href="http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Responder">http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Responder</a>
(see also krb5.h)
` &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/OTPOverRADIUS">http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/OTPOverRADIUS</a>&gt;`__<a class="reference external" href="http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/OTPOverRADIUS">http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/OTPOverRADIUS</a>
The KDC OTP plugin does not permit dynamic configuration. For this
reason, we will provide a companion daemon which is an intelligent
proxy/multiplexer. This daemon listens for RADIUS packets on a UNIX
socket and will forward the authentication request, based on the user’s
configuration in LDAP, to either LDAP (via an LDAP bind) or a 3rd party
RADIUS server. The daemon will be socket activated by systemd when the
KDC attempts to connect. The companion daemon will re-use krb5 RADIUS
code for simplicity. This implies that the companion daemon will have
two dependencies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>libverto - for main loop</p></li>
<li><p>libkrb5/libk5crypto - for randomization, MD5 hashing and krb5 data
types</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No other dependencies are required. The 3rd party RADIUS daemon is not
owned by us, so no specification is necessary. However, the LDAP daemon
(389) will gain an implementation of RFC 6238.</p>

<section id="token-types">
<span id="id7"></span><h2>Token Types<a class="headerlink" href="#token-types" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>TOTP (time-based) tokens are fully supported.</p></li>
<li><p>HOTP (counter-based) tokens are somewhat functional, but not
supported. This is due to the fact that counter replication is
extremely costly in a replicated environement.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="logic">
<h2>Logic<a class="headerlink" href="#logic" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>There will be a global policy in the ipaConfig (so it is replicated)
to control authentication methods across the deployment. There also
be the same attribute in the user entry. If the attribute in the user
entry is not present then the global setting will be respected. If
the global setting is also not present the current existing logic
would be assumed. This will be a multi-valued string attribute called
ipaUserAuthType. Possible values for that attribute are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“password” - password authentication is allowed</p></li>
<li><p>“otp” - 2FA (password + OTP) authentication is allowed</p></li>
<li><p>“pkinit” - pkinit is allowed</p></li>
<li><p>“radius” - RADIUS proxying is allowed</p></li>
<li><p>“disabled” - all extended authentication methods (local OTP
authentication or remote OTP proxy over RADIUS) are disabled
regardless of the data in the user entry. This value is applicable
only to the global setting and will be ignored in the local
setting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If global setting is set to “disabled”, only the password
authentication is allowed. In all other cases a combination of global
flags defines the default allowed methods. The value in user entry,
if explicitly set, overwrites the global value in this case. For
example if the global says “otp” and a user account has the value of
“password” than every account must use OTP and only this single
account is allowed to use password. In other words the global setting
provides the default that can be overwritten on the per entry basis.
Since the attribute is multivalued, a combination of multiple
attributes is possible. For example “password” + “pkinit” is
equivalent to the current default behavior. Configuring RADIUS proxy
for an account or assigning a token to that would not be enough for
the system to start using RADIUS or 2FA (respectively) for the
account. The attribute must be set to “radius” / “otp” either
globally or per-user. Invalid (misspelled) values would be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>KDB will use this attribute in user entry and in the global
configuration and merge it when it presents data to the KDC. The KDC
would make a decision what preauth methods to send to client based on
that value. If only “otp” is present only “otp” preauth will be
possible, i.e. only OTP preauth mechanism will be present in the
preauth request. This means that it would work only on the clients
that support “OTP” preauth method and not on the older clients that
do not support OTP. This is an expected behavior. Old client would
automatically fail. This means that if “otp” is required for the user
the deployment would need to make sure that the user would log only
via clients that fully support OTP preauth method</p></li>
<li><p>To allow either 2FA or password authentication both “otp” and
“password” should be specified. KDC then will send both OTP and
encrypted timestamp methods. On the older clients the otp would be
ignored and user input would be sent to KDC using encrypted timestamp
algorithm. This will allow users to authenticate with passwords from
the older systems. NOTE: Current limitations of MIT’s kinit causes
the encrypted timestamp method to always be selected even when OTP is
offered. To work around this, FreeIPA currently disables enctyped
timestamp when OTP is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixed mode “otp” + “password” should not be used until we implement
the ability to record which authentication method was used inside the
ticket. Once this is done we would be able to use discretion and
create service tickets for specific services only if the policy
allows user to access that service. This functionality is planned for
later so in the initial implementation mixing “otp” and “password”
methods would not be possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If “otp” method is enabled for the account the client will receive
the request, prompt the user and put the user input into the OTP
authentication data and ship to the server within the Kerberos FAST
tunnel protected by Kerberos identity of the client. The use of the
FAST tunnel requires the use of the -T option with kinit.</p></li>
<li><p>KDC will receive the response from the client and if the response
contains OTP auth data the KDC will create a RADIUS request and
forward it to the companion daemon.</p></li>
<li><p>Companion daemon at the start will read all possible RADIUS
configurations from the LDAP server and cache them. It will refresh
them if it sees that any of them change.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon receiving of the RADIUS request from the KDC companion daemon
will look-up user account by principal. If the user account contains
a link to the RADIUS configuration the radius request will be sent to
that RADIUS server using already cached configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Companion daemon might perform remapping of the user name depending
on the configuration.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If a special overriding attribute ‘ipatokenRadiusUserName’ is
present in the user entry the value of this attribute will be used
as a user name in the proxied RADIUS request.</p></li>
<li><p>If the attribute is not present but RADIUS server configuration
contains an attribute ‘ipatokenUserMapAttribute’ then the
attribute that it points to will be used as a source of the user
name.</p></li>
<li><p>If neither specified (default) ‘uid’ attribute will be used.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If there is no link to the RADIUS server in the user entry companion
daemon will perform a local LDAP bind using a DN of the looked up
user entry as a bind DN and provided user input as a credential
assuming that user authenticates with a locally defined OTP token.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be a new DS bind plugin that would perform the
authentication. It will be used by the companion daemon but would
allow any client to authenticate using OTP code. This will be
equivalent to simple bind so non local LDAP clients would have to
bind over SSL/TLS to not expose the user provided passcode in clear.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of successful authentication the reply will be sent to the
caller. If the caller is companion daemon it would in turn reply to
KDC and KDC will reply to the client with a TGT.</p></li>

<span id="id8"></span><h2>Lost Token Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#lost-token-processing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the case of the external RADIUS server is configured for user
account the lost token processing is completely opaque and delegated
to the external RADIUS server to handle.</p></li>
<li><p>If the user with OTP token assigned to him inside IPA losses his
token there are two ways to handle this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If token is permanently lost (together with device it is on) it
should be disabled and a new token should be issued to the user.</p></li>
<li><p>If token is not permanently lost but rather left home or in some
place where user would be able to get a hold of it later without
jeopardizing the system security then help desk admin should set
the expiration on that status. Following administrator’s actions a
special attribute will be added to that token. This attribute
would specify a moment when the misplaced token must be found.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the attribute is present and time has not elapsed yet the
user would be able to use just his password because the
presence of the valid attribute would force the server to treat
the length of the OTP token code to be 0 (temporarily).</p></li>
<li><p>If user authenticates with the full OTP code while the
attribute is valid that would indicate the the token is found
and attribute will be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>If time passes and token is not found it would require a manual
intervention to revive/remove this token. Any attempts to
authenticate with such token would automatically fail.</p></li>

</ul>

lost token methods are implemented.</p></li>
